# Mapping the Chemicals Investigation Programme (2015-2020)
This project was designed to make use of the underexplored Chemicals Investigation Programme 2 (CIP2) dataset to inform governmental stakeholders of environmental and public health risks. The Programme aimed to determine the concentrations of substances of potential concern in wastewater, with Phase 2 of the Â£140 million programme running from 2015-2020. The data covers 74 substances, totalling three million determinations from over 600 sewage treatment plants and rivers in the plants' catchment areas.

The database and more information can be found on the CIP2 [website](https://ukwir.org/the-chemicals-investigation-programme-phase-2,-2015-2020).
