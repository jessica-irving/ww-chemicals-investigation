# Mapping the Chemicals Investigation Programme (2015-2020)
This project makes use of the underexplored Chemicals Investigation Programme 2 (CIP2) dataset, with a view to mapping chemicals of concern in English wastewater that are of relevance to public and environmental health. 

## CIP2 Dataset 
The Programme aimed to determine the concentrations of substances of potential concern in wastewater, with Phase 2 of the Â£140 million programme running from 2015-2020. The data covers 74 substances, totalling three million determinations from over 600 sewage treatment plants and rivers in the plants' catchment areas.

The database and more information can be found on the CIP2 [website](https://ukwir.org/the-chemicals-investigation-programme-phase-2,-2015-2020).
