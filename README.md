# Mapping the Chemicals Investigation Programme (2015-2020)
From the homepage of the programme's [website](https://ukwir.org/the-chemicals-investigation-programme-phase-2,-2015-2020):

<i>"The UKWIR Chemicals Investigation Programme (CIP) is the UK water Industry’s response to current and emerging legislation on trace substances in the water environment. It brings together the water and wastewater companies in England and Wales with the various regulators in a collaborative programme. The current phase, known as CIP2, is a substantial development of the initial phase of work, undertaken from 2010 to 2014, that sought to prioritise substances of potential concern and to determine the concentrations of such substances in wastewater. CIP2 is budgeted at £140 million. It comprises over three million determinations in the period 2015 to 2020, with sampling covering 74 substances at over 600 sewage treatment plants. Investigations of treatment processes and river catchment-wide assessments are included."</i>
